# Pokemon Rumble Passcodes

Pokemon Rumble has a passcode system that allows players to recruit Pokemon using eight digit codes. These passcodes were hard coded into the game and were periodically revealed in promotional material for the game. While many of these codes were officially revealed and have been known since 2009 there are dozens of passcodes that were never officially revealed. We have analyzed the game data to provide a complete list of passcodes available for this game.

**Note:** Passcodes are regionalized and will only work with their designated region. Third party mods such as Rumble Weekend also modify the passcode data which may affect the availability of specific passcodes.

## English (US) Passcodes

The following table of passcodes will work with any non-modified version of Pokemon Rumble (US).

## Technical Info 
Pokemon Rumble stores passcodes internally as hashes of their text. The algorithm used is `SHA1(SHA1(passcode_text))`. Hash functions are one way, meaning the original data is lost during the hashing process and can not be reconstructed from the hash alone. Fortunately Pokemon Rumble passcodes are trivial to brute force. Passcodes have 10 possible characters to the power of eight digits meaning there are only 100m combinations to try.

The passcode data is stored in the `CItem_nakama.pkc` file. The location of this file varies based on the region of the game. Here are the locations of these files.

- US - `00000005.app` > `USA` > `script.arc.cx` > `CItem_nakama.pkc`
- EU - `00000005.app` > `EUR` > `script.arc.cx` > `CItem_nakama.pkc`
- JP - `00000005.app` > `script.arc.cx` > `CItem_nakama.pkc`

PKC files appear to be scripts used by the game. While we have yet to fully reverse engineer these files there are common structures in the data that we used to extract the passcode data. The bytes `3F000000` appear to indicate that the next value is a word (16 bytes) and `4000` appears to indicate that the next value is a halfword. The following table is our current understanding of the passcode data structure.

| Hex      | Description                           |
|----------|---------------------------------------|
| 3F000000 | Start of the passcode. Read 16 bytes. |
| XXXXXXXX | First 16 bytes of the has             |
| 3F000000 | Read next 16 bytes.                   |
| XXXXXXXX | Bytes 17 -> 32 of the hash            |
| 3F000000 | Read next 16 bytes.                   |
| XXXXXXXX | Bytes 33 -> 48 of the hash            |
| 3F000000 | Read next 16 bytes.                   |
| XXXXXXXX | Bytes 49 ->  64 of the hash           |
| 3F000000 | Read next 16 bytes.                   |
| XXXXXXXX | Bytes 65 ->  80 of the hash           |
| 4000XXXX | The species of the pokemon            |
| 4000???? | Unknown                               |
| 4000XXXX | Power modifier, similar to lvl        |
| 4000XXXX | Move 1 ID                             |
